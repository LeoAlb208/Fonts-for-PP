# Fix PowerPoint Font Preview (No More "Download Font" Issues!)  

![PowerPoint font preview issue](assets/preview.png)  

Are you tired of seeing **"Click to download"** and not being able to instantly see **all previews** of PowerPoint fonts?  

This repository solves that by letting you **instantly preview all fonts** without manually clicking each one.  

**Please note**: depending on when you download this folder, some fonts might be missing or newly added.  
This is because Microsoft may update the list of available Cloud Fonts over time.  

## ‚úÖ What This Fixes

- PowerPoint not showing font previews  
- Manually clicking fonts just to preview them  

## üí° How It Works

PowerPoint stores cloud fonts in a hidden local folder. These fonts are automatically downloaded when used in a presentation but are not present locally until you view them.  
This repo contains **all Cloud Fonts** so that you don't have to manually select every single one of them.  

## üìÅ How To Use It

1. Download the contents of the [`Fonts`](./Fonts) folder in this repo.  
2. Paste them into this path on your computer:  
   C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\FontCache\4\CloudFonts  
   (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username.)  
3. Restart PowerPoint ‚Äì all font previews should now be visible!  

## üì• Download Fonts Folder Only  

Don't want to download the whole repo?  

üëâ [Click here to download only the `Fonts` folder](https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/LeoAlb208/PowerPoint-Font-Preview-Fix/tree/main/Fonts)  
**It might take some time**. If you're wondering if it's downloading... Don't worry! It is.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Notes  

- Tested on PowerPoint for Microsoft 365 (Windows 11).  
- This folder contains the cloud font previews available at the time of publishing.  
  Microsoft occasionally updates its Cloud Fonts collection, so:  
  - Some **older fonts** might have been added since your download.  
  - Some **newer fonts** may not be included yet.  
- If a specific font preview is still missing, you need to manually select it in PowerPoint ‚Äî it will be downloaded and cached automatically.
