# Easy Preview for All Fonts on PowerPoint
Are you annoyed by the [download font thingy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cae8c332-884f-4d62-bc61-d2c81483ea75) on PowerPoint?  
You don't want to click on every single font to be able to see its preview?  

Download all the files inside my [Fonts folder](), put them in this folder:  
**C:\Users\......\AppData\Local\Microsoft\FontCache\4\CloudFonts** (replace the dots with your Username)  
and be done with it!!
