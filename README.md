# Fix PowerPoint Font Preview (No More "Download Font" Issues!)  

![PowerPoint font preview issue](assets/preview.png)  

Are you tired of seeing **"Click to download"** and not being able to instantly see **all previews** of PowerPoint fonts?  

This repository solves that by letting you **instantly preview all fonts** without manually clicking each one.  

## ‚úÖ What This Fixes

- PowerPoint not showing font previews  
- Manually clicking fonts just to preview them  

## üí° How It Works

PowerPoint stores cloud fonts in a hidden local folder. These fonts are automatically downloaded when used in a presentation but are not present locally until you view them.  
This repo contains **all Cloud Fonts** so that you don't have to manually select every single one of them.  

## üìÅ How To Use It

1. Download the contents of the [`Fonts`](./Fonts) folder in this repo.  
2. Paste them into this path on your computer:  
   C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\FontCache\4\CloudFonts  
   (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual Windows username.)  
3. Restart PowerPoint ‚Äì all font previews should now be visible!  

## üì• Download Fonts Folder Only
